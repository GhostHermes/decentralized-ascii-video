# Decentralized ASCII Video dApp

**A collaborative project to build a decentralized platform for sharing unique, low-bandwidth video expressions preserved on the blockchain.**

## What is this?

Imagine a video-sharing platform like TikTok, but with a twist:

* **ASCII Art Videos:** Videos are converted into stylized ASCII art, creating a unique viewing experience and minimizing storage needs.
* **Blockchain-Powered:** Video ownership and core data live on the blockchain, ensuring long-term persistence and decentralization. 
* **Community-Driven:** Designed  with a focus on sustainability, mutualist values, and open governance.

## Why Does This Exist?

* **Exploration of creative limitations:**  ASCII conversion forces us to rethink how we represent video, sparking unexpected creativity.
* **Preservation:**  By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to create a repository of creative expression less susceptible to platform changes or disappearing content.
* **Decentralized Experiment:**  We believe in empowering users and moving away from centralized control of content.

## Get Involved!

This project is in its early stages, and we welcome enthusiastic contributors! Here's how you can help:
