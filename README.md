# Decentralized ASCII Video Sharing

What is this?
Imagine a video-sharing platform like TikTok, but where your creations live on the blockchain! This project is an experiment in decentralized creativity. Videos get converted into a low-resolution, text-based format called ASCII, making them more easily sharable and practically impossible to erase.

Why does this matter?
Resilience: Storing creative content on the blockchain increases its permanence. Nothing can be taken down or censored in the same way as with traditional platforms.
Retro Cool: ASCII videos have a unique, low-fi charm that brings a fun constraint to the video creation process.
Collaboration: This project is fully open-source and built with mutualist principles. We want the community to shape how it develops.
Who is this for?
Creators: Experiment with a new form of video expression and preserve your work on the blockchain.
Developers: Build with us! Contribute to smart contracts, front-end design, or create tools around the platform.
The Crypto-Curious: If you're new to web3 and NFTs, this is a simple project to understand and learn from.
