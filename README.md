# Decentralized ASCII Video dApp

**A collaborative project to build a decentralized platform for sharing unique, low-bandwidth video expressions preserved on the blockchain.**

## What is this?

Imagine a video-sharing platform like TikTok, but with a twist:

* **ASCII Art Videos:** Videos are converted into stylized ASCII art, creating a unique viewing experience and minimizing storage needs.
* **Blockchain-Powered:** Video ownership and core data live on the blockchain, ensuring long-term persistence and decentralization. 
* **Community-Driven:** Designed  with a focus on sustainability, mutualist values, and open governance.

## Why Does This Exist?

* **Exploration of creative limitations:**  ASCII conversion forces us to rethink how we represent video, sparking unexpected creativity.
* **Preservation:**  By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to create a repository of creative expression less susceptible to platform changes or disappearing content.
* **Decentralized Experiment:**  We believe in empowering users and moving away from centralized control of content.

## Get Involved!

This project is in its early stages, and we welcome enthusiastic contributors! Here's how you can help:

* **Coding:** Help build our smart contracts, front-end interface, and ASCII conversion engine.
* **Testing:**  Find bugs, suggest features, and make our dApp better for everyone.
* **Spread the Word:** Share this project with those excited about decentralized tech and creative expression.

## Development Setup

Welcome aboard! To jump into contributing to this project, you'll need to set up your local development environment using Hardhat. Here's a quick guide to get you started:

**Prerequisites:**

* **Node.js (version 14 or later):** Download and install Node.js from the official website ([https://nodejs.org/en](https://nodejs.org/en)). Node.js comes bundled with npm, the Node Package Manager, which we'll use to install dependencies.
* **Git version control (optional, but recommended):** Install Git if you don't have it already. You can download it from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Git is a powerful tool for version control and collaboration, making it easier to track changes and work with others on the project.

**Steps:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   If you haven't already, clone this repository to your local machine using Git. You can find detailed instructions on cloning a repository in the Git documentation: [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)

   Once you've navigated to your terminal or command prompt, run the following command, replacing `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of this project's repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
Navigate to Project Directory:

Use the cd command to change directories into the project folder you just cloned:

Bash
cd decentralized-ascii-video
Use code with caution.
Install Dependencies:

Within the project directory, run the following command in your terminal to install the necessary dependencies using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install


This command will download and install all the required software packages (libraries) needed to run the project using Hardhat.

Congratulations! You've now set up your development environment and are ready to start contributing to the project. The next steps will involve writing smart contracts and building the front-end interface. Keep an eye on the README and other project documentation for further instructions.

Additional Notes:

If you encounter any issues during setup, feel free to consult the Hardhat documentation for troubleshooting tips: https://hardhat.org/docs
Consider joining the project's discussion forum or chat channel (if available) to connect with other contributors and get help if needed.
By following these steps, you'll be well on your way to collaborating on this exciting decentralized video sharing project!
